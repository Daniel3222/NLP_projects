# Normalization

##### normalizer.py is a small python script that can help one normalize a corpus. In this scenario, I used that script for a task that consisted in finding the age class of blog users based on their writings.

##### The python script consists of many regular expressions meant to normalize strings. They were previously used on a dataframe, that is why the function returns a dataframe. Normalization is one important step in Natural Language Processing as it helps removing unneeded variation in strings. For example, all expressions of happyness by emojis can be normalized to one token. That can facilitate an algorithm in learning how to represent such an emotion.
