# Normalization

##### Few lines of code that can help normalize text before processing it
##### Also an easy way to extract Named entity recognition features from processed dataframe

### Normalizer.py is a small python script that can help one normalize a corpus. It consists of many regular expressions meant to normalize strings. They were previously used on a dataframe, that is why the function returns a dataframe. So the script is mostly intended for strings cleaning in dataframes.

### Normalization is a crucial part in natural language processing.
